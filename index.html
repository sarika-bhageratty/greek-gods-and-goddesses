          Let's dive into the world of Greek mythology with the Big Four: Zeus,
          Hera, Aphrodite, and Apollo.

      <h2>Meet the Big Four</h2>
      <p>
        Now, you may be wondering who the Big Four are and why they're such a
        big deal. These guys are the some of the most powerful gods and
        goddesses in Greek mythology and are still worshipped to this day,
        thousands of years later! They are four of the 12 Olympians, or major
        Greek deities, and each represent something special.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, what makes them so special? Because each of the Big Four represent
        powerful forces which the Greeks believed influenced their lives. If we
        understand the Gods and Goddesses, we are then able to understand why we
        fall in love, why storms happen, why tragedies occur. Plus, their
        stories are just straight up awesome and are practically soap operas!

            <h2>Zeus: The King of the Gods</h2>
            <p class="section-description">
              Think of Zeus as the principal of the gods, the head honcho. He's
              the king of the gods, and the top dog on Mount Olympus, the gods'
              hangout spot. He's super powerful: he controls the weather (often
              flexing this power with lightning bolts!), makes sure everything
              is fair and just, and keeps things running pretty smoothly. His
              symbols are things that show his power, like the thunderbolt,
              eagle, and lion. He's the guy who makes the rules and everyone has
              to listen to him. But... he's also kind of a player. He's always
              having affairs, which makes his wife, Hera, totally furious. Oh,
              and did we mention that his wife is also his sister?

              Hera is the queen of the gods and Zeus's wife (and sister, which
              was pretty normal back then). Since she's the goddess of marriage
              and family, she's not too happy about Zeus's infidelity! She's
              always plotting revenge on the women he messes around with and is
              basically the ultimate scorned woman. Hera's associated with
              symbols of power and beauty like the peacock and pomegranate.

              Our girl Aphrodite is the OG baddie. She is the goddess of love
              and beauty, and she's drop dead gorgeous. The Venus de Milo statue
              is supposed to be her, but it's missing its arms, so we don't know
              for sure what she was holding. People back then debated whether it
              was Aphrodite or Amphitrite, the sea goddess, but because of the
              jewelry she wore, they thought it was probably Aphrodite. Anyway,
              Aphrodite was a major player in the Trojan War. She promised the
              most beautiful woman in the world, Helen, to a Trojan prince,
              Paris, which started a huge war. She's usually shown with things
              that symbolize love and beauty, like doves, roses, and apples.

              Our body Apollo is a sophisicated, multi-talented baller. He's the
              god of light, music, poetry, and healing, but stay on his good
              side because he can also bring plagues if he's in a bad mood. He
              and his twin sister, Artemis, were born on the island of Delos,
              but Apollo is most associated with his temple at Delphi. This was
              a super important place in ancient Greece because it had an
              oracle. People would travel there to ask Apollo's priestess
              questions about the future, and she'd give them cryptic answers
              that they'd try to figure out. He's often shown with a lyre, a
              musical instrument, and a bow and arrow, which shows he's got both
              a creative and a powerful side. We love a man of culture.
