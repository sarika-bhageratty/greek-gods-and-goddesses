        <p class="hero-description">
          Let's dive into the world of Greek mythology with the Big Four: Zeus,
          Hera, Aphrodite, and Apollo.

      <h2>Meet the Big Four</h2>
      <p>
        You may be wondering who the Big Four are. The Big Four are the some of
        the most powerful gods and goddesses in Greek mythology. They are Zeus,
        Hera, Aphrodite, and Apollo. The Big Four are four of the 12 Olympians.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, why do they matter? Because they each represent powerful forces
        which the Greeks believed influenced thier lives. If we understand the
        Gods and Goddesses, we are then able to understand why we fall in love,
        why storms happen, why tragedies occur. Plus, their stories are just
        straight up awesome!

            <h2>Zeus: The King of the Gods</h2>
            <p class="section-description">
              Think of Zeus as the principal of the gods. He's the king of the
              gods, and the top dog on Mount Olympus, the gods' hangout spot.
              He's super powerfulâ€”controls the weather (think lightning bolts!),
              makes sure everything is fair, and keeps things running smoothly.
              His symbols are things that show his power, like the thunderbolt,
              eagle, and lion. He is like the guy who makes the rules and
              everyone has to listen to him. But he's also kind of a player.
              He's always having affairs, which makes his wife, Hera, totally
              furious.

              She's the queen of the gods and Zeus's wife (and sister, which was
              normal back then). Since she's the goddess of marriage and family,
              she's not too happy about Zeus's cheating! She's always plotting
              revenge on the women he messes around with. She's basically the
              ultimate scorned woman. She's also associated with symbols of
              power and beauty like the peacock and pomegranate.

            <h2>Aphrodite: Goddess of Love</h2>
            <p class="section-description">
              She's the goddess of love and beauty, and she's seriously
              stunning. The Venus de Milo statue is supposed to be her, but it's
              missing its arms, so we don't know for sure what she was holding.
              People back then debated whether it was Aphrodite or Amphitrite,
              the sea goddess, but because of the jewelry she wore, they thought
              it was probably Aphrodite. Anyway, Aphrodite was a major player in
              the Trojan War. She promised the most beautiful woman in the
              world, Helen, to a Trojan prince, which started a huge war. She's
              usually shown with things that symbolize love and beauty, like
              doves, roses, and apples.

            <p class="section-description">
              This god is multi-talented. He's the god of light, music, poetry,
              and healing, but he can also bring plagues if he's in a bad mood.
              He and his twin sister, Artemis, were born on the island of Delos,
              but Apollo is most associated with his temple at Delphi. This was
              a super important place in ancient Greece because it had an
              oracle. People would travel there to ask Apollo's priestess
              questions about the future, and she'd give them cryptic answers
              that they'd try to figure out. He's often shown with a lyre, a
              musical instrument, and a bow and arrow, which shows he's got both
              a creative and a powerful side.
